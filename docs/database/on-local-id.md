The `local_id` serves a crucial purpose in this seeding system. It allows you to create persistent references between your JSON files and the database records without depending on auto-generated database IDs.

Here's why it's necessary:

1. **Referential integrity across seeders**: When you add a chapter that refers to a course, you need a way to say "this chapter belongs to that specific course." In your JSON files, you use identifiers like "course_01", but in the database, these entities have UUID primary keys that are auto-generated.

2. **Incremental seeding**: When you run the seeders multiple times (adding new data incrementally), you need to know which records already exist in the database to avoid duplicates. The `local_id` helps track which of your JSON entities have already been inserted.

3. **Future modifications**: If you need to update existing records later, the `local_id` gives you a stable reference to identify specific records.

For example, in your JSON:

```json
{
	"v1": [
		{
			"id": "course_01",
			"title": "Making a Drummer"
		}
	]
}
```

When inserted into the database, this becomes:

```
id: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" (auto-generated UUID)
local_id: "course_01" (from your JSON)
title: "Making a Drummer"
```

Then in your chapters.json:

```json
{
	"v1": [
		{
			"id": "chapter_01",
			"course_id": "course_01",
			"title": "Reading"
		}
	]
}
```

The seeder can find the real UUID in the database by looking up the course with `local_id` of "course_01".

Without this mapping system, you'd have to manually update your JSON files with database IDs after each seeding operation, which would be error-prone and time-consuming.

**More about the "id"**

The "id" in your JSON can be anything you want as long as it's unique for that item within its collection. These IDs are just references used within your seed data and don't need to match the format of your database's UUIDs.

For example, you could use:

- Descriptive IDs: `"id": "drum_basics_course"`, `"id": "reading_chapter"`
- Sequential IDs: `"id": "course_01"`, `"id": "chapter_01"`
- Topic-based IDs: `"id": "quarter_notes_section"`, `"id": "drum_rudiments_collection"`

The only requirements are:

1. Each ID must be unique within its own entity type (no two courses can have the same ID)
2. IDs must be consistent when referenced from other entities (if a chapter references `"course_01"`, that course must exist with that exact ID)

These IDs are just for your reference system - they'll be stored in the `local_id` column in the database, but won't affect the actual primary keys, which will still be auto-generated UUIDs.
