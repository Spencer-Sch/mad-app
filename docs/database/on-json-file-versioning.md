**Question**:
let's say I've added section data multiple times so that I'm up to a "v3" in sections.json. I now want to add a subsection but have not added any subsection data previously. my subsections.json would start at "v1"? is that correct?

**Answer**:

Yes, that's exactly right. Your version numbers are independent for each entity type, so your `subsections.json` would start at "v1" even though your `sections.json` is already at "v3".

Here's how it would look:

```json
// sections.json
{
  "v1": [...],
  "v2": [...],
  "v3": [...]
}

// subsections.json (new file)
{
  "v1": [
    {
      "id": "quarter_notes_subsection",
      "section_id": "notes_and_rests_section",
      "title": "Quarter Notes",
      "page_number": 20,
      "description": "Understanding quarter notes and their duration"
    }
  ]
}
```

The version numbers are just a way to organize incremental additions to each entity type. They don't need to match across different entity types, and each JSON file has its own independent versioning.

When you run `npm run seed:subsections` for the first time, the system will see that this is the first time subsections are being added and will process all items in the "v1" array.
