Here's an updated guide to reflect the changes made to your seeding system:

# Guide to Seeding Script Commands

Here's a comprehensive guide to all the different ways you can use the seeding commands in your package.json, and when each option is most useful:

## Basic Commands

### Seed All Entities (Latest Entity IDs)

```bash
npm run seed
```

**When to use:** When you've made changes to multiple entity types and want to add all new data organized by their respective entity IDs. This is good for initial setup or when adding related data across multiple tables.

### Seed All Entities (All Entity IDs)

```bash
npm run seed:all
```

**When to use:** When you need to completely rebuild your database from scratch, including all data for all entity IDs. Useful when setting up a new environment or after wiping your database.

### Seed Specific Entity Type (Latest Entity ID)

```bash
npm run seed:courses
npm run seed:chapters
npm run seed:sections
# etc.
```

**When to use:** When you've only added data to one specific entity type and want to seed just that data. This is the most common usage during incremental development.

## Advanced Command Options

### Seed Specific Entity Type with Specific Entity ID

```bash
npm run seed -- chapters making-a-drummer
npm run seed -- sections ch1
npm run seed -- collections sub-whqnr
```

**When to use:** When you want to seed only a specific entity ID within an entity type. Useful for selectively adding or updating data for a specific part of your content hierarchy.

### Seed Specific Entity Type with All Entity IDs

```bash
npm run seed -- courses --all
npm run seed -- exercises --all
```

**When to use:** When you want to reseed all data for a specific entity type. Useful when you've made corrections to data across multiple entity IDs.

### Seed All Entity Types with Specific Entity ID Pattern

```bash
npm run seed -- all s1-1
```

**When to use:** When you want to seed data that corresponds to a specific pattern across all entity types. This is useful when you've added related content across multiple tables.

## Examples for Specific Scenarios

### Adding New Content

You've added new exercises to the "col-enqn" collection:

```bash
npm run seed -- exercises col-enqn
```

This seeds just the exercises for the "col-enqn" collection.

### Adding a New Section

You've added a new section "s1-2" to chapter 1:

```bash
npm run seed -- sections ch1
```

This seeds all sections defined in the chapter 1 key of your sections.json file.

### Database Reset

You need to completely rebuild your database:

```bash
npm run seed:all
```

This seeds all entity IDs of all entity types in the correct dependency order.

### Selective Seeding for Testing

You're testing a specific feature that involves only certain entity types:

```bash
npm run seed:courses
npm run seed:chapters
```

This seeds only the latest entity IDs for courses and chapters.

### Adding Related Data for a Specific Section

You've added new data related to section "s1-1" across multiple entity types:

```bash
npm run seed -- subsections s1-1
npm run seed -- collections sub-whqnr
```

This ensures all data related to section "s1-1" is added consistently.

By using these different command variations, you can precisely control what data gets seeded and when, making your development process more efficient and better organized. The entity ID-based approach gives you a natural way to organize and reference your data according to your method book's structure.
